DataCube version 0.03
=====================


INSTALLATION

Open a terminal and change directory into blackbear/trunk/build.
You may need sudo priveleges during the 'make install' step of installation.

After changing your working directory, simply type:

perl install.pl

The amount of unit testing involved is serious, checking everything from file system operations to numerical stability.
Installation may take up to one minute.  If you do not wish to wait, you may type

perl install.pl --test=0

Windows users, you are on your own.  Just copy the files where you need them to go.
I do not intend to support Microsoft's insane policies toward the "make" utility.



DEPENDENCIES

The only prerequisite to install blackbear is a working copy of perl, version 5.8.x or higher.
